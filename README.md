Working as a product designer at [Webflow](https://webflow.com/) — a tool that makes producing for web more approachable. Mostly trying to figure out how to create the right visual tools for designers

## things I worked on before, 2012–2014

### Stampsy

Worked as a designer (and partly as a front-end engineer) at Stampsy — a web platform for sharing and discovering visual stories. I designed the product and built a modular CSS architecture behind it.

### Stampsy iPad app

In 2012, before becoming a web platform, Stampsy was an experimental iPad app for creating stories with a simple design editor. I designed and prototyped a lot of its touch-based interactions with different tools and codez.

## misc

At some point I designed a UI theme↗︎ for Sublime Text — a popular code editor. It has been installed by ~300k users and has ~7k stars on GitHub.

During 2010–2012 I've freelanced and worked with various international startups, but most of the time I was just posting useless stuff↗︎ on Dribbble.

In my early twenties I've played a lot of World of Warcraft — a multiplayer online game. It's quite intense and requires a lot of concentration. I had a lot of fun designing and building custom interfaces for it, which improved my performance and overall game experience. I think that's what got me into design.
